The Holly,Bibek Dhungana,1,"I’m the guarantor for Apartment 627A. We have signed leases for both Summer and Fall, and August rent is fully paid.

Today, Justice Vasquez entered our apartment without notice, falsely claimed we never renewed our lease, and told her to leave immediately or the police would be called. I heard the entire exchange on the phone — it was threatening, intimidating, and completely unprofessional.

This happened despite all paperwork and payments being in order. No prior communication, no record check, no apology. Just harassment.

This conduct is unacceptable and unprofessional. As a large apartment community, I would expect any lease concerns to be addressed through proper communication channels or respectful communication, not through intimidation or threats.

If you value respect and safety, avoid this place at all costs. Management needs to fix their records and train staff immediately.

Update: The issue has since been resolved, and I appreciate the management addressing it. The apart"
The Holly,Joshue Lewis,5,"I absolutely love living at The Holly! The location is unbeatable, especially for students, being just 7 minutes away from campus.

The facilities here are top-notch. The gym is well-equipped and the pool area is pretty. The management and staff are so nice and they organize regular activities for residents, making it easy to meet new people and feel connected to your neighbors. Overall, I highly recommend The Holly to anyone looking for a convenient, comfortable, and community-oriented living experience."

The Holly,Kelcy Walling,5,"The unit we moved in to was honestly okay, I see where people are having issues in the reviews. But as far as my unit, it was fairly clean, and me and my roommate keep up with the cleanliness so we don’t notice anything off. There were times when the water pipes froze and there were issues, but they did warn us in advance on how to combat that and in some cases some units flooded from frozen pipes, including ours. But that was our fault as we used the washer thinking it would be fine. They solved that issue by bringing in carpet tech and making sure the units dried completely to prevent mold. They are good with maintenance and rarely do we wait long periods of time before things get fixed. I enjoy my time here(:"
The Holly,Amber Petty,3,"I lived at the holly for like 6 months. It honestly wasn’t horrible, maintenance could be improved by just communicating better but they did fix all of the work orders I put in! My room did have an odor when I moved in that never went away, and there was noisy neighbors. The shared space was decent. Overall I’d live there again if I could! You get what you pay for!"
